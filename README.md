## Project Name
PlantManager

I want this project to:
    1. ask the user for the name of a plant
    2. take input of plant name
    3. ask condition of plant (healthy, yellow, brown)
    4. if healthy say good job!
    5. if yellow provide steps to fix it 
    6. if brown provide steps to fix it 

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'plant_manager'
```
And then execute:
    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:
    $ gem install plant_manager

## Usage
TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development
After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
