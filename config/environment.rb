#A complex program might require 100s of individual files containing source code, method definitions, classes, and more that together constitute all the code required to run the application. We call this code the application's environment. We generally put all the code required to initialize the environment within config/. We might see that in a config/environment.rb file or even an entire config/environments/ directory.

#What does it mean to "initialize a program's environment?" Establishing the environment for your program can involve a number of things, but on the most basic level, the config file or directory is responsible for things like file requirements (i.e. making sure your different files have access to one another), establishing connections to your database (if you have one) and ensuring that your test suite has access to the files that contain the code it is testing.
